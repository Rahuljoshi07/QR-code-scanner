# QR Code Scanner

This project implements a QR Code Scanner using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The QR code scanner provides two options for the user to scan QR codes:

1. **Upload Image:** Allows users to upload an image file containing the QR code.
2. **Camera Scan:** Allows users to use the camera of their system to scan the QR code directly.

After scanning the QR code, the application displays an alert message with the decoded text of the QR code.

## Features

- Supports scanning QR codes from image files.
- Allows users to use their system camera to scan QR codes.
- Displays decoded text of the scanned QR code in an alert message.
